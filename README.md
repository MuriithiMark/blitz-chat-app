# Challenges
Working on the project was challenging, transitioning from React-Query to RTK Query was fun and a great learning experience. I love how while using RTK Query everything seems seamlessly and runs flawlessly. Just as state should should be, a single source of truth.
Folder Structure is key in managing your project well, a poor folder structure makes refactoring very hard. For me using folders for even a single component proved beneficial as it separated my code into small understandable blocks"
